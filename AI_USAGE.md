AI usage for this project
=========================

This file documents how AI tools were used during development, per course policy.

Date: 2025-11-30

Tools used:
- ChatGPT / GitHub Copilot (assistant integrated in VS Code), used to suggest code changes, refactor modules, and generate small helper functions.

Scope of AI assistance:
- Suggested and implemented refactorings to modularize code: `src/data_loader.py`, `src/evaluation.py`, `src/models.py`.
- Implemented robust yfinance fetcher with fallbacks and retry logic.
- Added demo and reproducibility improvements (seeding RNGs).
- Wrote unit test scaffolding and small test helpers.

What was NOT done by AI:
- I validated, reviewed, and approved all code changes.
- I am responsible for the final report, interpretation of results, and any model selection decisions.
