AI usage for this project
=========================

This file documents how AI tools were used during development, per course policy.

Tools used:
- OpenAI Codex (Codex CLI) for code edits, debugging support, and drafting report text.
- ChatGPT for writing, clarification, and troubleshooting guidance.
- GitHub Copilot (assistant integrated in VS Code) to suggest code changes and small helper functions.

Scope of AI assistance:
- Helped debug errors and clarify fixes during development.
- Suggested and implemented refactorings to modularize code: `src/data_loader.py`, `src/evaluation.py`, `src/models.py`.
- Drafted small helper functions and code snippets later reviewed and integrated by the author.
- Implemented robust yfinance fetcher with fallbacks and retry logic.
- Added demo and reproducibility improvements (seeding RNGs).
- Edited report text for clarity and structure.

What was NOT done by AI:
- I validated, reviewed, and approved all code changes.
- I am responsible for the final report, interpretation of results, and any model selection decisions.
